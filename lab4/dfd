I want to get strong leadership experience by actively getting involved in Student Government as one of the Committee Chairs for the Student Senate.


I feel I have solid organizing skills that I can use during my period at this position. I would like to keep the committee well-organized and great involvement from its members.

I used to be School Captian during my school period.
I used to be a Class Representative during senior years of high school.
I have organized several programs in high school.
I have volunteered and organized several committee betterment programs in my home town.
